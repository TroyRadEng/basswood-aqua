## plan
* Awesome plan: http://www.koiphen.com/forums/showthread.php?137281-Basement-Aquaponics-System
* Another thought: System should be built with mobility (even if difficult mobility) in mind.  We might want to use the system in a commerical capacity and the basement would probably not pass inspection as a production facility.
* possible cost-cutting measure: build everything out of 50 gallon barrels https://albany.craigslist.org/grd/d/plastic-barrels/6657411079.html
* use fish that can drive in cold water, eat a varied diet, grow quickly and are edible http://homeaquaponicssystem.com/fish/top-7-aquaponics-fish-species/
* best choice is probably catfish (hardy like carp but taste better) http://www.aquaponiclynx.com/channel-catfish-2

## possible plants
* lettuce and other greens
* taro
* pickerel weed

## mealworms
* will assist with feeding the system (and also the lizards)
* They need to be moved upstairs to prevent mold issues
* However, there should be a smaller form factor option to avoid clutter
